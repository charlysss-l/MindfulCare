          Exercise is not just about physical healthâ€”it also has a significant 
          impact on mental well-being. Engaging in regular physical activity 
          can reduce stress, improve mood, and enhance cognitive function.
        </p>

        <h3>How Exercise Improves Mental Health</h3>
        <p>
          1. Reduces Stress: Physical activity helps lower cortisol levels, the hormone responsible for stress.<br/>
          2. Boosts Mood: Exercise triggers the release of endorphins, often called feel-good hormones.<br/>
          3. Enhances Brain Function: It improves memory, focus, and overall cognitive performance.<br/>
          4. Improves Sleep: Regular exercise promotes better sleep patterns and reduces insomnia.<br/>
          5. Fights Anxiety & Depression: Studies show that consistent exercise can be as effective as medication for mild depression.
